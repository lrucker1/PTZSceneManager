   any other notable divergence from Sony, like OSD toggle.
   delay needed between start move and stop, esp for OSD.

Should localhost be saved as an "Internet" password?
  It looks like it's not propagated to other Macs, so yes?

Add Export to PacketSender to this app.

Lock scene name editing - part of the whole UI lock?

Get the camera's actual aspect ratio for the live view constraint? 16:9 is the current default.
snapshot.jpg resolution options: 1920x1080 (16:9, 1.777) 960x600 (8:5, 1.6) 480x300 (1.6)

Pluggable controls:
Instead of the "Low light/sports day/night", have user-definable light settings. Like "Candles".

Undo on collection item removal.

Refresh the "Add/Edit" window

menu item to bring up osd
"Lock UI" menu item.

Export the settings to something readable. Even if that turns out to be settings.ini.

Range copy (recall/set) in Camera Scenes. Also range overlap check - intersectsIndexesInRange
Progress dialog for snapshot import... actually it's pretty fast. Keep it around for when we do range copy.

Observe USB device add/remove for camera scene windows- only if we have one. Although given that we can't do that at all for IP cams, it's very optional.

Show current range in a different color, stripy (colorWithPatternImage:) on overlaps.
