 Export the settings to something readable. Even if that turns out to be settings.ini.

Yes! obs-websocket to find out which camera is hot. And works with the plugin in 2.7.

Prefs:
   Brand/Model specific stuff:
   max preset, reserved presets
   has livestream, livestream URL, URL format
      PTZOptics rtsp://[ipaddress]:554/1 (and a /2 for hdmi?)
      and if it's html?
   has website, ditto.
      PTZOptics [ipaddress]:8080
   snapshot URL
      PTZOptics [ipaddress]:80/snapshot.jpg
   any other notable divergence from Sony, like OSD toggle.
   delay needed between start move and stop, esp for OSD.

Configure cameras: should this all be part of the Camera List UI? Advantage: you can see all the names, because they're the OBS key.
 - set PTZOptics brand or not.

Add Export to PacketSender to this app.

Lock scene name editing - part of the whole UI lock? "Lock UI" menu item?
 only if someone wants it in beta

Get the camera's actual aspect ratio for the live view constraint? 16:9 is the current default.
snapshot.jpg resolution options: 1920x1080 (16:9, 1.777) 960x600 (8:5, 1.6) 480x300 (1.6)

Pluggable controls:
Instead of the "Low light/sports day/night", have user-definable light settings. Like "Candles".
Also transition effects, like "relative zoom in".
  - alas, even the slowest zoom speed is way too fast.
  - a "record mode", that computes the difference between two scenes and saves just that change? Future.
Auto sharpness?
Preset speed?
 - Scene-specific local saves for presetRecall & anything else with no inq.
Focus lock/unlock - not in Sony?
PTZ Advanced View:
 Exposure mode dependent:
    Shutter speed up/down
    Iris brighter/darker
    Brightness up/down
 Image Color: Luminance Contrast Hue
    and show meaningful values, sheesh.

Range copy (recall/set) in Camera Scenes. Also range overlap check - intersectsIndexesInRange
Progress dialog for snapshot import... actually it's pretty fast. Keep it around for when we do range copy.

Observe USB device add/remove for camera scene windows- only if we have one. Although given that we can't do that at all for IP cams (actually, we could, but more research is needed), it's very optional. OTOH - disconnecting and reconnecting IP is fast. USB takes some time between power on and it actually being available.

Add cameras in Cam Collection.
Update after IP/USB change.

Test importing a second different/overlapping set of cameras.
