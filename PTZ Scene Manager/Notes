 Export the settings to something readable. Even if that turns out to be settings.ini.

Yes! obs-websocket to find out which camera is hot. And works with the plugin in 2.7.

Prefs:
   Brand/Model specific stuff:
   max preset, reserved presets
   has livestream, livestream URL, URL format
      PTZOptics rtsp://[ipaddress]:554/1 (and a /2 for hdmi?)
      and if it's html?
   has website, ditto.
      PTZOptics [ipaddress]:8080
   snapshot URL
      PTZOptics [ipaddress]:80/snapshot.jpg
   any other notable divergence from Sony, like OSD toggle.
   delay needed between start move and stop, esp for OSD.

Configure cameras:
 - set PTZOptics brand or not.

Add Export to PacketSender to this app.

Lock scene name editing - part of the whole UI lock? "Lock UI" menu item?
 only if someone wants it in beta

Get the camera's actual aspect ratio for the live view constraint? 16:9 is the current default.
snapshot.jpg resolution options: 1920x1080 (16:9, 1.777) 960x600 (8:5, 1.6) 480x300 (1.6)

Pluggable controls:
Instead of the "Low light/sports day/night", have user-definable light settings. Like "Candles".
Also transition effects, like "relative zoom in".
  - alas, even the slowest zoom speed is way too fast.
  - a "record mode", that computes the difference between two scenes and saves just that change? Future.
Auto sharpness?
Preset speed? Maybe with a "Set" button, so it doesn't override preset.
 - Scene-specific local saves for presetRecall & anything else with no inq.
Focus lock/unlock - not in Sony?
PTZ Advanced View:
 Exposure mode dependent:
    Shutter speed up/down
    Iris brighter/darker
    Brightness up/down
 Image Color: Luminance Contrast Hue
    and show meaningful values, sheesh.

Range copy (recall/set) in Camera Scenes. Also range overlap check - intersectsIndexesInRange
Progress dialog for snapshot import... actually it's pretty fast. Keep it around for when we do range copy.

ArrayController in CameraList. It's so close. OTOH, it does work.
Check whether the NSViewController commitEditing actually does work, given that discard works.

Test importing a second different/overlapping set of cameras.

camlist & prefs window restoration

Clean up delete pref values on launch? (after undo is no longer possible)

Test changing ttydev

Apply All in Camera List. Also normal Add button, and should it be Delete menu item or Remove button?

TODO when I have a real IP cam: optimize the ping timeout.

UI for absolutely disconnected, failed ping, where's my camera. Notification? Overlay window?

Camera name on pulled-off OSDremote
